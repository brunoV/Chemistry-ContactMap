NAME
    Chemistry::ContactMap - An interface for ContactMap classes

VERSION
    version 0.100890

DESCRIPTION
    Chemistry::ContactMap is a Mouse role that implements a minimal
    interface for ContactMap classes. It currently adds simple "structures"
    and "contacts" attributes, and enforces the implementation of
    "contacts"' lazy builder.

ATTRIBUTES
  structures
    Holds two read-only and required "Chemistry::MacroMol" objects whose
    contacts will be computed. It coerces from opened filehandles to PDB
    files, and also from strings with the contents of said PDB files.

    Thus, these will all work:

        My::Class->new( structures => \@fhs     );
        My::Class->new( structures => \@strings );
        My::Class->new( structures => \@mols    );

  contacts
    Read only, lazily-built attribute without a type. You are encouraged to
    add one in the consuming class. Also, you must implement a
    "_build_contacts" method that will populate this attribute when its
    getter method is called.

SYNOPSYS
        {
            package My::Class;
            use Mouse;

            with 'Chemistry::ContactMap';

            ...
        }
